# 💻 Introduction to C++ - Programming Assignments
This repository contains my assignments from **Laboration 1 to 5** in my very first C++ programming course. The course focused on learning the fundamentals of programming using C++ — including syntax, control structures, functions, data types, arrays, file I/O, and more.

## 🧾 Topics Covered
Throughout these laborations, I practiced and learned:

- ✅ C++ syntax and structure

- 🔢 Variables and data types (int, float, char, string, etc.)

- 🧮 Expressions, operators, and input/output with cin / cout

- 🔁 Control structures: if, else, for, while

- 🧱 Arrays, std::string, and std::vector

- ✍️ Reading from and writing to text files

- 🧰 Functions and header files

- 📦 struct usage

## 🛠️ How to Build and Run

This project uses **CMake** to compile all assignments into individual executables.

### ✅ Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g. `g++`)
- [CMake ≥ 3.2](https://cmake.org/download/)
- A terminal (Linux, macOS, or WSL/MinGW on Windows)

### 🔧 Build Steps

1. **Open a terminal and navigate to the project root:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/this/repository
   ```
   
2. **Create a build directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
   
3. **Generate build files and compile:**
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   make
   ```
   
4. **Run any compiled assignment, for example:**
    ```bash
    ./dt018g-LAB_1_ASSIGNMENT_1
    ```

The output binaries will be named according to the lab and assignment, such as:
- ```dt018g-LAB_2_ASSIGNMENT_3```
- ```dt018g-LAB_5_ASSIGNMENT_1B```
