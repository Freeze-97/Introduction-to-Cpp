# 💻 Introduction to C++ - Programming Assignments
This repository contains my assignments from **Laboration 1 to 5** in my very first C++ programming course. The course focused on learning the fundamentals of programming using C++ — including syntax, control structures, functions, data types, arrays, file I/O, and more.
